# Walking Gecko :lizard: - A jQuery Practice Exercise

Use jQuery to:
1. Change the background colour on the body.
2. Change the h1 to a different font-family.
3. Make the geckos stroll to the other side of the field when you hover your mouse over them. Hint: you will need to use the jQuery *$(this)* selector. It has the same role as JavaScript's keyword *this*.
